# Data Vis Song Recommender

This Song Recommender is a web application for exploring new songs based on some known songs. With a database including any song you can think of, and plenty that you have never heard of, this tool is unlike any you have seen before.  All required libraries and modules are included in this package in order for the server to run effectively. In order for the user to begin interacting with the tool, ensure you have an up to date version of Python installed on your computer. 

	The main function that selects songs based on user input is contained in songMethods.py. In order to turn these recommendations into a visualization that is appealing and way to understand for the views, forcegrah.html and index.html utilizes html, d3, and css styling to output the front-end visual to your local webpage. Once the package is installed and running on your browser (see instructions below), you will be able to discover new song recommendations based on any song you wish, along with various attribute filters.


## Installation

Clone the code to your local repository


## Usage

Run app.py in the project's top-level directory:

```bash
python app.py
```

This command should spit out some text that contains a link to your local host (e.g. [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/)). Navigate there in your web browser of choice.
